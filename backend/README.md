## Measurement Jobs – Queue workers

This app uses two queues so that long file-generation jobs do not block chunk processing:

- **`generation`** – runs `GenerateMeasurementsJob` (creates the big .txt file).
- **`default`** – runs `ProcessChunkJob` and `AggregateResultsJob`.

Run **two** workers (e.g. in separate terminals):

```bash
php artisan queue:work --queue=generation
php artisan queue:work --queue=default
```

That way, when a 1B-row job is generating on `generation`, smaller jobs’ chunk and aggregation work can still run on `default`.

### Retry mechanism

Failed queue jobs are retried automatically:

- **GenerateMeasurementsJob:** 3 tries, backoff 10s → 30s → 60s, timeout 1 hour. After all retries, the measurement job is marked failed with the exception message.
- **ProcessChunkJob:** 3 tries, backoff 10s → 30s → 60s, timeout 10 minutes. If all retries fail, the batch fails and the measurement job is marked "One or more chunk jobs failed".
- **AggregateResultsJob:** 3 tries, backoff 10s → 30s → 60s, timeout 15 minutes. On success it sets the job’s `memory_used_bytes` to the sum of chunk processing memory and marks the job completed or partial. After all retries, the measurement job is marked failed with the exception message.

To change retries or backoff, edit `$tries` and `$backoff` on each job class.

### Real-time job progress (Reverb main, Pusher optional)

Real-time progress uses **Laravel Reverb** by default (self-hosted WebSocket server). No polling.

**Backend**

1. In backend `.env`: ensure `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb` and set Reverb credentials (e.g. from `php artisan reverb:install`, or copy from `.env.example` and fill `REVERB_APP_ID`, `REVERB_APP_KEY`, `REVERB_APP_SECRET`; keep `REVERB_HOST=127.0.0.1`, `REVERB_PORT=8080`, `REVERB_SCHEME=http` for local).
2. Start Reverb when developing: `php artisan reverb:start` (or use `composer dev`, which runs it with the API and queue).

**Frontend**

3. In frontend `.env` or env: set `NUXT_PUBLIC_REVERB_APP_KEY` to your backend `REVERB_APP_KEY`, and optionally `NUXT_PUBLIC_REVERB_HOST`, `NUXT_PUBLIC_REVERB_PORT` (default 8080), `NUXT_PUBLIC_REVERB_SCHEME` if different from defaults.

**Optional: use Pusher instead**

- Backend: set `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=pusher` and add `PUSHER_APP_ID`, `PUSHER_APP_KEY`, `PUSHER_APP_SECRET`, `PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER`.
- Frontend: set `NUXT_PUBLIC_USE_PUSHER=true`, `NUXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY`, `NUXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER`.

If neither Reverb nor Pusher is configured, the app still works; progress is shown after refresh or when you re-open a job. The frontend refetches the job list when a job completes or is partial so the Memory column in the list stays correct.

### Filament admin panel

A **Filament v5** admin panel is available at **/admin** (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`). The app also has a custom Admin page in the Nuxt frontend for users with `is_admin`.

### Admin dashboard (frontend)

Admin access is seeded from environment variables in `backend/.env`:

`FILAMENT_ADMIN_NAME`, `FILAMENT_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `FILAMENT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`

Then run:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=FilamentAdminUserSeeder
```

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
